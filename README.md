Introduction to Robotics - weekly homewoks

This repo will contain my weekly homeworks for my Introduction to Robotics course I'm taking at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Univeristy of Bucharest.
For each homework, I will provide requirements, implementation details, code files, pictures and videos of the setup and whatever else could be helpful.
