Introduction to Robotics - weekly homewoks

This repo will contain my weekly homeworks for my Introduction to Robotics course I'm taking at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Univeristy of Bucharest.
For each homework, I will provide requirements, implementation details, code files, pictures and videos of the setup.

## Homework 2

### Requirements

Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you  need  to  read the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write a mapped value to the LED pins.
