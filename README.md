Introduction to Robotics - weekly homewoks

This repo will contain my weekly homeworks for my Introduction to Robotics course I'm taking at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Univeristy of Bucharest.
For each homework, I will provide requirements, implementation details, code files, pictures and videos of the setup.

## Homework 2

### Requirements

Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you  need  to  read the  potentiometer’s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write a mapped value to the LED pins.

## Homework 3

### Requirements

Design  a  control  system  that  simulates  a  3-floor  elevator  using  the  Arduino platform. 

•LED Indicators: Each of the 3 LEDs should represent one of the 3 floors. The LED corresponding to the current floor should light up. Additionally, another LED should represent the elevator’s operational state. It shouldblink when the elevator is moving and remain static when stationary

•Buttons: Implement 3 buttons that represent the call buttons from the3 floors. When pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towards the floor after a short interval (2-3 seconds)

•Buzzer: The buzzer should sound briefly during the following scenarios:

  –Elevator arriving at the desired floor

  –Elevator  doors  closing  and  movement
